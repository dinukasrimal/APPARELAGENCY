# External Inventory Management System

## Overview

The inventory module has been modernized to use only the External Inventory Management system. All legacy inventory components have been removed and replaced with a comprehensive external inventory solution.

## Current Implementation

### **External Inventory System** (`ExternalInventory.tsx`)
- Complete external inventory management with multi-source data integration
- Global sync functionality for processing all users' data
- Advanced product matching and categorization
- Real-time transaction tracking and stock management
- User-specific display filtering while maintaining global data processing

### **Supporting Components**
- `SimpleBulkStockAdjustment.tsx` - Streamlined stock counting and adjustments
- `ExternalStockAdjustmentApproval.tsx` - Approval workflow for stock changes
- `ExternalStockAdjustmentHistory.tsx` - Historical tracking of adjustments
- `ProductAutoMatcher.tsx` - Automated product matching for data consistency

### **Services**
- `external-inventory.service.ts` - Core inventory operations and data management
- `external-bot-sync.ts` - External bot data synchronization with product matching
- `local-invoice-sync.ts` - Local database transaction processing with global sync capabilities

## Key Features

### **Global Sync**
- **Superuser Access**: Global sync button available for superusers
- **Multi-User Processing**: Processes ALL users' inventory data in a single operation
- **User-Specific Display**: Each user only sees their agency's inventory data
- **Comprehensive Data Sources**: Syncs from external bot, local invoices, sales, and returns

### **Product Matching**
- **Three-Tier Strategy**: Exact name → product code → fuzzy matching
- **Agency-Specific**: Matches products within the correct agency context
- **Statistics Tracking**: Detailed match rates and unmatched product reporting
- **Visual Indicators**: Shows matched (✓) vs unmatched (⚠) products in UI

### **Transaction Types**
- **External Bot Invoices**: Stock IN from external bot system
- **Local Sales**: Stock OUT from local database invoices
- **Customer Returns**: Stock IN from customer returns
- **Manual Adjustments**: Stock count adjustments with approval workflow

## Usage

### **Regular Users**
1. Navigate to Inventory module
2. Use "Sync My Transactions" to sync your agency's data
3. View your inventory with real-time stock levels
4. Perform stock adjustments as needed

### **Superusers**
1. Use "Global Sync (All Users)" to process all agencies' data
2. Monitor match rates and data quality
3. Approve stock adjustments across all agencies
4. Access comprehensive inventory analytics

### **Stock Management**
1. **Stock Count**: Use "Stock Count" button for bulk adjustments
2. **Approvals**: Superusers can approve/reject adjustment requests
3. **History**: View complete transaction and adjustment history
4. **Categories**: Organize inventory by categories with sidebar navigation

## Data Flow

1. **External Bot Sync**: Fetches invoices from external database → matches products → creates inventory transactions
2. **Local Database Sync**: Processes sales, returns → links to product catalog → updates stock levels
3. **Global Processing**: Combines all data sources → maintains user access control → provides complete inventory picture
4. **Display Filtering**: Users see only their agency data while benefiting from complete data processing

## Benefits
