✅ Updated Global Sync Features:

1. 📊 Data Source: external_bot_project_invoices (last 25 invoices)
2. 🔍 Fuzzy Product Matching:
   - Cleans product names (removes [CODE], (CODE), CODE: patterns)
   - Tries EXACT match first: name ILIKE 'cleanedName'
   - Falls back to PARTIAL match: name ILIKE '%cleanedName%'
   - Populates matched_product_id when product found

3. 📝 Insert Process:
   - Creates records in external_inventory_management
   - Sets external_source = 'global_bot'
   - Includes matched_product_id from products table
   - Includes external_product_id from line data

4. 🎯 Product Matching Examples:
   "[SB42] SOLACE-BLACK 42" → cleanName: "SOLACE-BLACK 42" → find in products table
   "(CV90) COLOR VEST 90" → cleanName: "COLOR VEST 90" → find in products table
   "CODE123: Product Name" → cleanName: "Product Name" → find in products table

5. 📊 Results Tracking:
   - globalMatchedProducts: Count of successfully matched products
   - globalUnmatchedProducts: Count of products without matches
   - processedCount: Total line items processed
   - createdTransactions: Total records created
